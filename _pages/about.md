I am a PhD student at the School of Artificial Intelligence (SAI) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Linfeng Zhang](http://www.zhanglinfeng.tech/). I am broadly interested in various aspects of data-centric AI, deep learning theory (especially in foundation models), and explainable machine learning.

Previously, I was a master's student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) at SJTU, where I was grateful to be mentored by Prof. [Junchi Yan](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn/). Prior to SJTU, I received my B.Eng. degree from HIT in 2022.

Currently, I also closely work with Prof. [Zhuoran Yang](https://zhuoranyang.github.io/) at Statistics and Data Science at [Yale University](https://statistics.yale.edu/).

<!-- Previously, I got my B.Eng. degree from HIT in 2022, and enjoyed wonderful time during my internship at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) and [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). -->


<!-- My long-term research goal includes:
1. Discover, probe, and boost key features/neurons in the learning of deep neural networks (DNNs).
2. Conduct theoretically principled post-hoc analysis of DNNs for debugging.
3. Design self-explainable DNNs that maintain strong performance in real scenarios. -->

Beyond academia, I have a rich background in the arts and sports. I've been playing the piano for over a decade and had the honor of performing alongside the renowned pianist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lang_Lang">Lang Lang</a>. In my teenage years, I won several chess championships in Anhui Province, China, under the mentorship of Grandmasters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeng_Chongsheng">Chongsheng Zeng</a> and Master Yongjin Zhou. While my musical roots are in classical music, I have a strong affinity for R&B and Neo-Soul genres. My interests also extend to detective and historical novels, and the intriguing world of magic cubes.

<!-- I have played the piano for more than 10 years, and was fortunate to co-played with greatest pianist [Lang Lang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lang_Lang) years ago. During my teenage years, I held won multiple Chess championships in Anhui Province, China, under the supervision of chess grandmaster [Chongsheng Zeng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeng_Chongsheng) and Yongjin Zhou. While my roots are in classical music, my musical tastes lean towards R&B and Neo-Soul. Beyond music and chess, my curiosity extends to detective and historical narratives, as well as the complex world of Magic Cubes. I can solve more than 10 kinds of cubes ($$n\times n$$, Megaminx, Pyraminx, Skewb, Square $$n$$, etc). -->


<!-- #### Miscellaneous
My journey towards the world of artificial intelligence began in my adolescence as a semi-professional chess player. At the age of 12, I learned about the legendary Garry Kasparov’s defeat by the AI “Deep Blue.” This was my first brush with the awe-inspiring capabilities of AI. Years later, my fascination deepened when DeepMind’s AlphaGo conquered the world champion in Go, further igniting my curiosity about the mechanisms behind these “world champion” AIs. During my undergraduate studies, I was introduced to the fundamentals of machine learning, which led to an intrinsic problem: beyond basic statistical models, deep learning models remained mysterious to us. Deep Learning seems more like empirical evidence than rigorous science. A question appeared in my mind: how can we interpret these “black box” models, or better yet, design “white box” models? This journey from a young chess enthusiast to an aspiring AI researcher has been driven by the mystery of deep neural networks for understanding and a deep commitment to making AI more trustworthy and reliable. -->
