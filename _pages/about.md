I am now a second-year master's student at [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Junchi Yan](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn/). Previously, I got my B.Eng. degree from HIT in 2022.

<i class="fa-light fa-face-smile" style="color: #1a57c1;"></i> My research spans around trustworthy artificial intelligence and its real-world applications. My encounter with XAI crystallized my long-term research goals, which include:
• Discovering and probing key features in the learning of DNNs.
• Conducting theoretically supported post hoc analysis of DNNs to detect errors.
• Designing inherently explainable networks that maintain strong performance.


I am always open for possible collaborations, and am looking for **visiting and Ph.d. opportunities**, if you are interested, please do not hesitate to contact me!


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
