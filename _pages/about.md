I am a PhD student at the School of Artificial Intelligence (SAI) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Linfeng Zhang](http://www.zhanglinfeng.tech/). I am broadly interested in various aspects of data-centric AI, deep learning theory (especially in foundation models), and explainable machine learning. Currently, I also closely work with Prof. [Zhuoran Yang](https://zhuoranyang.github.io/) at Statistics and Data Science at [Yale University](https://statistics.yale.edu/).

Previously, I was a master's student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) at SJTU, where I was grateful to be mentored by Prof. [Junchi Yan](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn/). Prior to SJTU, I received my B.Eng. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2022.

<b>:blush: Short bio.</b> I was born in Hefei, China, a leading city for scientific research. Outside of academia, I have been playing the piano for over a decade. I once had the honor of performing alongside the world-renowned pianist [Lang Lang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lang_Lang). My favorite composers include [FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin) and [Franz Liszt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Liszt). I also have a deep appreciation for R&B and Neo-Soul. During my teenage years, I won several chess championships in Anhui Province, China, under the guidance of Chess Grandmaster [Chongsheng Zeng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeng_Chongsheng) and Chess Master Yongjin Zhou.
