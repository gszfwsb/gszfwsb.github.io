Beyond academia, I've been playing the piano for over 10 years and had the honor of performing alongside the renowned pianist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lang_Lang">Lang Lang</a>. My favorite composers are Chopin and Liszt. While my musical roots are in classical music, I have a strong affinity for R&B and Neo-Soul genres. In my teenage years, I won several chess championships in Anhui Province, China, under the mentorship of Grandmaster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeng_Chongsheng">Chongsheng Zeng</a> and Master Yongjin Zhou. I also like reading detective and historical novels, and solving magic cubes.
